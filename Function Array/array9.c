9. WAP to show difference between Structure and Union.
o  Structure: A structure is a user-defined data type 
		that groups variables of different data types
		 under a single name. Each member of a structure
		  occupies its own memory space. 
o  Union: A union is also a user-defined data type that
		 groups variables of different data types under a 
		 single name, but all members of a union share the
		  same memory location. Only one member can be 
		  accessed at a time.
